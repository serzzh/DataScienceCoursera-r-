Clean datasets contains following columns:

activity:               Activity:LAYING, SITTING, etc.  
subject:                ID of the subject that performing activities.  

X.mean:                 Mean values for merged training and sets.  
X.median:               Median values for merged training and sets.  

total_acc_x.mean:       Mean value of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.   
total_acc_x.median      ...for median values,   
total_acc_y(/z).mean(/median)   ... for Y/Z axes.   

body_acc_x.mean:       Mean value of the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.     
body_acc_x.median      ...for median values,   
body_acc_y(/z).mean(/median)   ... for Y/Z axes.   

body_gyro_x.mean:       Mean value of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.       
body_gyro_x.median      ...for median values,   
body_gyro_y(/z).mean(/median)   ... for Y/Z axes.
